<tr><td style="text-align:left">6</td><td>The "==" symbol checks for equality instead of assigning a variable. The built in "pi" variable should be used instead of the Ï€ symbol, which is not valid in R syntax.</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">7</td><td>The question specified that your vector should be specifically named "area" instead of what you have here.</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">8</td><td>The radii to be used were already defined in the problem by radii < seq(4, 20, 2), so there was no need to redefine it as a different vector. You can raise the items within the vector to the second power by using the symbol.</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">9</td><td>There is no need to define pi manually, as it already exists within r. Try typing "pi" into the R console and see what appears. Additionally, there should not be a space between the two symbols of the assignment operator (< - instead of < -)</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">10</td><td>This could have been correct, but you did not close the parentheses when defining radii.</td><td>1</td></tr>

<tr><td style="text-align:left">14</td><td>You can check your code solution in R to see if it is behaving as expected. Also, be careful about using proper variable names ("radii" instead of "raddi")</td><td>1</td></tr>
